** Tic Tac Toe game

This is a toy project and is no way meant to be optimized, I used it to hone some functional concepts, as well as to practice proper documentation and seperation of concerns.

- had an enlightment with array reductions, created a function that takes a data structure and an undefined number of functions using the rest operator, it then reduces the array to produce a boolean allowing every function to operate on the data structure and expects them to return a boolean, it returns true if any of them returns true. The function was called checkState.
